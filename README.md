# StopMotion
## About
Simple but working Sketch helping to generate stopmotion films by capturing images from an usb-webcam. I quickly wrote it for a [StopMotion-Workshop for kids](http://kinderunikunst2017.tommachtalles.net/) because there weren't many free/working/easy2use Applications around. There's a lot to improve, but it's working.      
     
The program captures jpeg-images and saves them under `/%ProgramDir%/data/images/%timestamp%/`.
**Use the MovieMaker (Processing>Tools>MovieMaker) to generate a QuickTime-Movie file out of it.**  

**Runs on:** Win/Mac/Linux.  
**Written in:** Processing.  

## Featuring
+ Onion Skinning [(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning)
+ Auto-Saving

## Not Featuring
+ Movie Export (instead: use the [MovieMaker-Tool](https://youtu.be/ud1WQgQzFWU?t=2m8s) provided by Processing or a Video-Editor)
+ Anything exceeding the absolute minimum.
